/*
    Flexbox : easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.


    CSS Flexbox Layout Module:
        -Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

           -- Block, for sections in a webpage
           -- Inline, for text
           -- Table, for two-dimensional table data
           -- Positioned, for explicit position of an element



    FLEX-CONTAINER:
        The flex container properties are:

            - flex-direction
            - flex-wrap
            - flex-flow
            - justify-content
            - align-items
            - align-content
