    BUBBLE SORT: -- This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. 

    TIME COMPLEXITY - worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n*n)

    PSUEDOCODE:
        - Start Loop from with a variable called 'i' from end of the array towards the beginning
            -- start and inner loop with a variable called 'j' from the beggining till 'i -1'
                --- if arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap both
        - return sorted array
