 Clickjacking is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a transparent iframe in a window to trick a user into clicking on a CTA, such as a button or link, to another server in which they have an identical looking window. 
 
 The attacker in a sense hijacks the clicks meant for the original server and sends them to the other server. 
 
 This is an attack on both the visitor themselves and on the server.




Fix for Clickjacking:

    -There are two possible directives for X-Frame-Options:

        --X-Frame-Options: DENY
        --X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN



1. deny directive :
    - The deny directive completely disables the loading of the page in a frame, regardless of what site is trying. 

2. sameorigin directive:
    - The sameorigin directive allows the page to be loaded in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.
